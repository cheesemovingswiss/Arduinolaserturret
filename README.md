# Arduino laser turret
### To make this you will need:
1. Arduino uno
2. Breadboard
3. MtM wires
4. MtF wires
5. Laser module
6. 2 potentiometers
7. 2 servo motors


## Wiring and method

The connections you need to make are:
 -  First Potentiometer:
    
    -   Connect one end of the potentiometer to 5v
    -   Connect the other end of the potentiometer to gnd 
    -   Connect the middle pin of the potentiometer to A0.
 -  Second Potentiometer:
    
    -   Connect one end of the potentiometer to 5v
    -   Connect the other end of the potentiometer to gnd
    -   Connect the middle pin of the potentiometer to A1.
 -  First Servo Motor:
    
    -   Signal Pin to 9.
    -   5v to 5v
    - gnd to gnd
 -  Second Servo Motor:
	-  Signal Pin to 10
    - 5v to 5v
    - gnd to gnd

 - Laser module:

	 - 5v to 5v
	 -  gnd to gnd

 

### Fyi:
- powering of a 9 volt battery doesn't work
- Place on a solid surface
- I recommend to stick down to cardboard for a better experience
- Get some potentiometer knobs
